    "Software architecture & design is the structure of a system, the elements it contains, and the relationship between those elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both levels of software design (high and low) are essential. They form a symbiotic relationship with each other that when in sync, \n",
    "can lead to high-quality software that is easy to maintain and change.\n",
    "That means everyone on the team holds the shared responsibility of understanding the high-level architecture and how the low-level \n",
    "details support it.\n",
